# Implementing-PageRank

In an effort to better understand how powerful search engines such as Google function, I built the skeleton of the PageRank algorithm from scratch. Having created this algorithm I used it to recognize important characters in the famous Broadway Play "Hamilton" as well as the most frequented airports across the globe. 

PageRank expresses an intuitive idea: important pages are linked to other important pages. As such, I look at how often a character is mentioned by another character in Hamilton and how often a specific airport is visited in the context of departures/arrivals.
